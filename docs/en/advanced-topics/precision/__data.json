The number that follows the acronym (e.g., FP32, FP16) indicates how many bits of memory are used to represent a single number.

Modern GPUs, especially those from NVIDIA, include specialized hardware called Tensor Cores, designed to drastically accelerate low-precision calculations. Common Formats and Hardware Support (GeForce Examples); 1. FP32 (Full Precision - 32-bit): It's the \"highest quality\". Each number occupies 32 bits of memory.

Natively supported by the Ampere (RTX 30) series and later. Quantization and Advanced Hardware Support; Quantization converts weights into even lower formats (8 or 4 bits).

Hardware acceleration for FP8 is a flagship feature of the latest architectures, such as Ada Lovelace (RTX 40) which introduces native support, ensuring a significant performance increase with this format. Older cards can run it, but with much lower efficiency. ### A Deeper Look at FP8 The term `FP8` actually describes a family of formats. The main difference lies in how the 8 available bits are allocated between the Exponent (which determines the possible range of values) and the Mantissa (which determines the precision between one value and another). The two main standards are: - `E4M3`: Uses 4 bits for the exponent and 3 for the mantissa. It offers a good balance between range and precision, and is often used to store the model's weights. - `E5M2`: Uses 5 bits for the exponent and 2 for the mantissa. It has a wider dynamic range but less precision. It is typically used for gradients during training. FP8 Scaled is not a format in itself, but describes the technique of using a scaling factor to optimize the conversion of weights into FP8 format, maximizing precision in the most important range of values. Modern GPUs like the RTX 40 series handle these scaling factors very efficiently. - 4-bit (e.g., NF4): An extreme form of quantization, performance strongly depends on optimized software implementations that make the best use of the GPU's general capabilities. Hardware support has arrived with Blackwell (RTX 50)."],"uses":{"params":["lang","category","slug"],"parent":1}}]}
