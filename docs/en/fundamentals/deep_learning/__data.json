Deep Learning is a subcategory of Machine Learning based on Deep Artificial Neural Networks, that is, neural networks with many hidden layers (from tens to hundreds). The \"depth\" of the network is what allows it to learn to recognize patterns and hierarchies in the data automatically. How Does Learning Work?; Think of a child learning to recognize a cat: 1. First Layer (Simple): Learns to recognize basic elements like lines, edges, and colors. 2. Intermediate Layers (Complex): Combines these simple elements to recognize more complex shapes like pointed ears, whiskers, eyes. 3. Final Layers (Abstract): Combines the complex shapes to arrive at the abstract concept of \"cat\". Deep Learning works in a similar way. During training, the network analyzes millions of examples (e.g., labeled images) and autonomously adjusts the \"weights\" of the connections between its neurons to become increasingly better at mapping an input (an image) to a correct output (the \"cat\" label). Deep Learning vs. Traditional Machine Learning; In traditional Machine Learning, a specialist often had to \"pre-process\" the data and manually extract the important features for the model to analyze.
