A LoRa (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a small file that applies targeted modifications to a full checkpoint model, without permanently altering it. Think of a LoRa as an additional set of instructions or a transparent filter that you put over the main \"brain\" (the checkpoint) to make it adopt a specific style, replicate a character, or a concept. The main advantage of LoRas is their small size. While a full checkpoint can weigh several gigabytes, a LoRa typically weighs only a few megabytes (from 2 to 200 MB). This makes them easy to download, share, and use. How Do They Work?; Instead of retraining the entire model (an expensive process), a LoRa is trained to \"intercept\" and modify only a small part of the weights of the UNet and the Text Encoder. When you apply a LoRa, its small weights are added to those of the main model during generation, influencing the final result. Common Types of LoRas; LoRas are incredibly versatile and can be trained for different purposes: 1. Style LoRa: These LoRas teach the model a specific artistic style (e.g., \"Ghibli style\", \"pixel art\", \"baroque oil painting\"). They are among the most popular. 2. Character LoRa: Trained on images of a specific character (real or fictional), they allow that character to be inserted into any scene with good consistency. 3. Concept LoRa: They can teach the model a more abstract concept, such as a particular pose, a type of clothing, or a specific object. Usage in ComfyUI; In ComfyUI, LoRas are loaded via a `Load LoRA` node that is typically inserted between the `Load Checkpoint` and the `KSampler`. This node takes the model and the CLIP from the checkpoint as input and returns a \"modified\" version of both, ready to be used in the rest of the workflow. It is also possible to combine multiple LoRas (a process called stacking), applying different filters in sequence, although this can lead to unpredictable results if the LoRas conflict with each other."],"uses":{"params":["lang","category","slug"],"parent":1}}]}
