Image Segmentation is a Computer Vision process that consists of partitioning an image into multiple segments or regions, associating each pixel with a specific class label. In simple terms, it's how an AI \"breaks down\" an image to understand its content at a very detailed level. Instead of just seeing \"a photo of a street\", a segmentation model sees \"these pixels are 'road', these are 'sky', these are 'tree', and those are 'car'\". Types of Segmentation; There are several types of segmentation, but the most common are: - Semantic Segmentation: Each pixel is assigned a category (e.g., \"person\", \"cat\", \"grass\"). All objects of the same category have the same color in the segmentation map. - Instance Segmentation: It is more advanced. It not only labels pixels as \"person\", but distinguishes between \"person 1\", \"person 2\", etc. Each instance of an object is identified separately. Applications in Image Generation; Segmentation has become a powerful tool for controlling and modifying generated images: 1. ControlNet with Semantic Segmentation: It is possible to use a segmentation map as input for a ControlNet model. This allows dictating the composition of a scene very precisely. For example, you can provide a map with a blue area at the top (sky), a green one at the bottom (meadow), and a brown one in the middle (house), and the model will generate an image that exactly respects that spatial arrangement. 2. Automatic and Precise Inpainting: Advanced models like SAM (Segment Anything Model) from Meta AI can generate incredibly precise segmentation masks for any object in an image with a single click. In ComfyUI, this allows creating powerful inpainting workflows: you click on an object, SAM creates the perfect mask for it, and you can modify or replace it with a prompt, without having to draw the mask by hand. In summary, segmentation is a key technology that allows interaction and manipulation of images at a level of precision and intelligence that was previously unthinkable."],"uses":{"params":["lang","category","slug"],"parent":1}}]}
