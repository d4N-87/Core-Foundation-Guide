An Embedding, also known as Textual Inversion, is a small file that teaches the model a new visual concept by associating it with a specific keyword. Think of the CLIP model as a huge dictionary that links words to visual ideas. An embedding is as if you could add a new word to that dictionary. For example, you can train an embedding on 5-10 photos of your cat and associate it with the keyword `ohwx-cat`. From that moment on, every time you write `ohwx-cat` in your prompt, the model will know exactly which cat you are referring to. How Does It Work?; Unlike a LoRa that modifies the weights of the UNet (the \"painter\"), an embedding only modifies the weights of the Text Encoder (the \"translator\"). It doesn't teach the model to draw in a new style, but it teaches it the meaning of a new \"word\" (token). The file of an embedding is extremely small, often only a few kilobytes. Embedding vs. LoRa; | Feature | Embedding (Textual Inversion) | LoRa | | : | :--- | | Purpose | Teach a new concept (object, character) | Teach a new style or a complex character | | Component Modified | Text Encoder (CLIP) | UNet (and sometimes the Text Encoder) | | File Size | Very small (KB) | Small (MB) | | Flexibility | Less flexible, \"injects\" a concept | More flexible, can alter the entire style | Common Types of Embeddings; - Style: Although less common than LoRas for this purpose, some embeddings can replicate simple artistic styles. - Character/Object: The most common use. Perfect for creating consistent images of a specific person, animal, or object. - Negative Embedding: A special type of embedding trained on low-quality images (e.g., with deformed hands, ugly, etc.). By inserting the keyword of this embedding in the negative prompt, the overall quality of the image is greatly improved. Famous examples are `EasyNegative` or `bad-hands`. In ComfyUI, embeddings are usually loaded into a specific folder and then recalled simply by writing their keyword (the file name) directly in the prompt."],"uses":{"params":["lang","category","slug"],"parent":1}}]}
