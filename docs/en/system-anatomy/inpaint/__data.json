Inpainting and Outpainting are two powerful techniques that use diffusion models not to create an image from scratch, but to modify or extend specific parts of an existing image. Both are based on the same principle: providing the model with a partial image and asking it to \"fill in\" the missing parts coherently. Inpainting: Redrawing the Inside; Inpainting consists of replacing a portion of an image with something new, generated by the AI. The process is simple: 1. You start with an existing image. 2. You create a mask, that is, you \"color\" the area you want to modify. 3. You provide a new prompt that describes what you want to insert into the masked area. The model will use the unmasked area as context to generate the new content, trying to integrate it naturally in terms of style, lights, and shadows. It is the perfect technique for: - Correcting errors: Removing unwanted objects, fixing deformed hands. - Changing details: Modifying the color of a dress, changing the expression of a face. - Adding elements: Inserting a new character or an object into a scene. Outpainting: Expanding the Outside; Outpainting (or \"uncrop\") is the reverse process: instead of filling a hole inside the image, you expand the canvas outwards, asking the AI to imagine and draw what is beyond the original borders. The model uses the entire original image as context to generate the new pixels, extending the scene coherently. It is an incredibly useful technique for: - Changing the format: Transforming a vertical image into a horizontal one for a banner. - Correcting tight shots: \"Zooming out the camera\" to show more context around a subject. - Creating panoramas: Progressively extending an image in multiple directions to create vast landscapes. The Key Role of `Denoise`; In both techniques, the Denoise parameter is fundamental. It controls how much \"power\" the model has to ignore the original pixels (if present in the area to be modified) and follow the new prompt. - A high `denoise` will give the model more creative freedom. - A low `denoise` will try to preserve the structure and colors of the original area more."],"uses":{"params":["lang","category","slug"],"parent":1}}]}
