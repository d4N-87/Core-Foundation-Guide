Conditioning is the technical term that describes the guidance data that is provided to the UNet to influence and control the image generation process. Think of the UNet as a powerful but \"blind\" engine. On its own, it would only know how to remove noise in a generic way. Conditioning is the set of instructions and constraints that tell it how to remove the noise to achieve a specific result. In ComfyUI, conditioning is visually represented by the yellow wires that connect the various nodes. These wires do not carry images, but these packets of guidance data. Main Types of Conditioning; There are several \"sources\" of conditioning that can be combined for granular control: 1. Text Conditioning: It is the most common form of guidance. It comes from the CLIP Text Encoder, which transforms the positive and negative prompt into a numerical representation (embedding). This \"packet\" of data tells the UNet which concepts, objects, and styles it should represent. 2. Image Conditioning: This guidance does not come from the text, but from an image. It is the principle on which ControlNet is based. A ControlNet model analyzes an input image (e.g., a pose, a depth map) and transforms it into a conditioning that is added to that of the text. This type of conditioning imposes very strong structural and spatial constraints on the UNet. 3. Time Conditioning: It is a more \"internal\" type of conditioning. At each step of the sampling, information about the current \"timestep\" (e.g., \"we are at step 5 of 20\") is passed to the UNet. This allows it to know where it is in the process and to adjust its aggressiveness in removing noise accordingly. Combining Conditionings; The power of advanced workflows like those in ComfyUI lies in the ability to manipulate and combine these data flows. For example, it is possible to: - Mix the conditioning of two different prompts. - Apply a ControlNet only to a part of the prompt. - Guide the generation with multiple ControlNets simultaneously. In summary, every time you see a yellow wire in ComfyUI, you are looking at a communication channel that carries vital instructions to the heart of the model, the UNet."],"uses":{"params":["lang","category","slug"],"parent":1}}]}
