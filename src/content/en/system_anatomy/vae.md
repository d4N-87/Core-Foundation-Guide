The **VAE (Variational Autoencoder)** is the final decoder in your system.

Imagine the AI model doesn't "think" in images, but in an abstract mathematical language, a **latent space**. It's like a composer writing a score: the score isn't music, it's symbols on a sheet.

The VAE is the orchestra that reads that score and transforms it into the visual symphony you see on your screen. Without it, you'd only have the score (incomprehensible noise) and not the music (the final image).

### What does it do in practice?

- **From Latent to Pixels:** Its primary function is to convert the abstract representation (latent tensor) generated by the model into a real image, with pixels and colors.
- **Compression:** It can also do the reverse, compressing an existing image into its latent representation (the encoding process).
